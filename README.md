### ***Movie: Barbie Movie (2023)***
___
- As a kid I grew up watching different Barbie movies and series. It was basically my early childhood. As the new Barbie movie was announced during the year 2023, I couldn't help but get excited. Watching the film, I expected the target audience to be children, however, as the film progress I realize that it had a more deeper concept that what I expected. Although there were some satirical content in the film, it still tackles about views of the real-world and how one can easily be influenced by media. Moreover, it also covers some social awareness such as equality as it shows the way how different genders are treated in the real-world.
- What made me emotional is by the end of the film, it shows Rhea Perlman who was playing Ruth Handler (The one who invented the original Barbie doll) with Margot Robbie who was playing Barbier in a white space. As soon as Ruth said to Barbie. *"Take my hands. Now feel."* Barbie went through different aspects from childhood to adulthood, and how she can be more than just a doll.
